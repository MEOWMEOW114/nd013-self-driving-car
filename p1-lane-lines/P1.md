## Project: **Finding Lane Lines on the Road** 
***
In this project, you will use the tools you learned about in the lesson to identify lane lines on the road.  You can develop your pipeline on a series of individual images, and later apply the result to a video stream (really just a series of images). Check out the video clip "raw-lines-example.mp4" (also contained in this repository) to see what the output should look like after using the helper functions below. 

Once you have a result that looks roughly like "raw-lines-example.mp4", you'll need to get creative and try to average and/or extrapolate the line segments you've detected to map out the full extent of the lane lines.  You can see an example of the result you're going for in the video "P1_example.mp4".  Ultimately, you would like to draw just one line for the left side of the lane, and one for the right.

In addition to implementing code, there is a brief writeup to complete. The writeup should be completed in a separate file, which can be either a markdown file or a pdf document. There is a [write up template](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-LaneLines-P1/blob/master/writeup_template.md) that can be used to guide the writing process. Completing both the code in the Ipython notebook and the writeup template will cover all of the [rubric points](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/322/view) for this project.

Let's have a look at our first image called 'test_images/solidWhiteRight.jpg'.  Run the 2 cells below (hit Shift-Enter or the "play" button above) to display the image.

**Note: If, at any point, you encounter frozen display windows or other confounding issues, you can always start again with a clean slate by going to the "Kernel" menu above and selecting "Restart & Clear Output".**

---

**The tools you have are color selection, region of interest selection, grayscaling, Gaussian smoothing, Canny Edge Detection and Hough Tranform line detection.  You  are also free to explore and try other techniques that were not presented in the lesson.  Your goal is piece together a pipeline to detect the line segments in the image, then average/extrapolate them and draw them onto the image for display (as below).  Once you have a working pipeline, try it out on the video stream below.**

## Ideas for Lane Detection Pipeline

**Some OpenCV functions (beyond those introduced in the lesson) that might be useful for this project are:**

`cv2.inRange()` for color selection  
`cv2.fillPoly()` for regions selection  
`cv2.line()` to draw lines on an image given endpoints  
`cv2.addWeighted()` to coadd / overlay two images
`cv2.cvtColor()` to grayscale or change color
`cv2.imwrite()` to output images to file  
`cv2.bitwise_and()` to apply a mask to an image

**Check out the OpenCV documentation to learn about these and discover even more awesome functionality!**

## Helper Functions

Below are some helper functions to help get you started. They should look familiar from the lesson!


```python

    """Applies a Gaussian Noise kernel"""
    return cv2.GaussianBlur(img, (kernel_size, kernel_size), 0)

def region_of_interest(img, vertices):

## Test Images

Build your pipeline to work on the images in the directory "test_images"  
**You should make sure your pipeline works well on these images before you try the videos.**


```python
import os
os.listdir("test_images_copy/")
```




    ['solidWhiteCurve.jpg',
     'solidWhiteRight.jpg',
     'solidYellowCurve.jpg',
     'solidYellowCurve2.jpg',
     'solidYellowLeft.jpg',
     'whiteCarLaneSwitch.jpg']



## Build a Lane Finding Pipeline



Build the pipeline and run your solution on all test_images. Make copies into the `test_images_output` directory, and you can use the images in your writeup report.

Try tuning the various parameters, especially the low and high Canny thresholds as well as the Hough lines parameters.


```python
# Canny thresholds
low_threshold = 50
high_threshold = 150

# Gaussian smoothing / blurring
kernel_size = 7

# region Selection
left_bottom = [0, 539]
right_bottom = [900, 539]
apex = [450, 300]

# Define the Hough transform parameters
rho = 1 # distance resolution in pixels of the Hough grid
theta = np.pi/180 # angular resolution in radians of the Hough grid
threshold = 10     # minimum number of votes (intersections in Hough grid cell)
min_line_length = 20 #minimum number of pixels making up a line
max_line_gap = 10    # maximum gap in pixels between connectable line segments
```


```python
def filter_colors(image_in):
    
     # Convert BGR to HSV
    hsv = cv2.cvtColor(image_in, cv2.COLOR_BGR2HSV)
    
    lower_white = np.array([200,200,200])
    upper_white = np.array([255,255,255])
    # Threshold the original image to get only white colors
    white_mask = cv2.inRange(image_in, lower_white, upper_white)
    white_res = cv2.bitwise_and(image_in, image_in, mask= white_mask)
   
    # define range of yellow color in HSV
    lower_yellow = np.array([90,100,100])
    upper_yellow = np.array([255,255,255])
    # Threshold the HSV image to get only yellow colors
    yellow_mask = cv2.inRange(hsv, lower_yellow, upper_yellow)
    yellow_res = cv2.bitwise_and(image_in, image_in, mask= yellow_mask)

     # Combine the two above images
    combined_image = cv2.addWeighted(white_res, 1., yellow_res, 1., 0.)

    return combined_image
```


```python
# TODO: Build your pipeline that will draw lane lines on the test_images
# then save them to the test_images directory.

def draw_lane_lines(img):
    """ img : numpy.ndarray of image"""
    # Only keep white and yellow pixels in the image, all other pixels become black
    image = filter_colors(img)
    
    # grayscale the image
    grayscale_image = grayscale(image)
    
    # apply Gaussian smoothing
    gaussian_blur_image = gaussian_blur(grayscale_image, kernel_size)
    
    edges = canny(gaussian_blur_image, low_threshold, high_threshold)
    
    imshape = image.shape
    vertices = np.array([[(0,imshape[0]),(imshape[1]/2, 300), (imshape[1],imshape[0])]], dtype=np.int32)
    
    masked_edges = region_of_interest(edges, vertices)
    
    # Run Hough on edge detected image
    line_image = hough_lines(masked_edges, rho, theta, threshold, min_line_length, max_line_gap)
    
    # Draw lane lines on the original image
    annotated_image = weighted_img(line_image, img)
    
    return annotated_image
```

## Reflection 1

My pipeline consisted of 5 steps. First, I only keep the white and yellow pixels of the image. Then, I converted the images to grayscale, then I applied Gaussian smoothing. Then I applied Canny Edges. And final steps is to filter based on region of interest. In current project, the region of interest can be roughly assumed as trapezium shape I.e. the road. 

In order to draw a single line on the left and right lanes, I modified the draw_lines() function by finding the slope of left and right lanes.
For each line in the input, slope greater than zero is for left lane while slope smaller than zero is for right lane.
For each lane(left and right), I use polyfit() from numpy to perform curve fitting to find the slope and b values in  # y = m*x + b.

## Reflection 2 

One potential shorting coming would be what would happen when the number of 'valid' lines input is insufficient to draw a proper lane lines.

possible improvement could be using a better slope_threshold value and we not drawing the lane lines if the number of valid input is not passing certain threshold value.



```python
original_image = mpimg.imread('test_images/solidWhiteRight.jpg')
annotated_image = draw_lane_lines(original_image)
plt.imshow(annotated_image)
# plt.imshow(original_image)
```




    <matplotlib.image.AxesImage at 0x11f2b1f60>




![png](output_20_1.png)



```python

# Annotate all test_images/*.jpg
# Save the annotated images as test_images/<original_filename>_annotated.jpg
test_images = os.listdir('test_images_copy/')

for image in test_images:
    annotated_image = draw_lane_lines(mpimg.imread((os.path.join('test_images_copy', image))))
    fname = image.split('.')[0] + '_annotated.jpg'  # add '_annotated' suffix to annotated image jpg file
    plt.imsave(os.path.join('test_images_copy', fname), annotated_image)
```

## Test on Videos

You know what's cooler than drawing lanes over images? Drawing lanes over video!

We can test our solution on two provided videos:

`solidWhiteRight.mp4`

`solidYellowLeft.mp4`

**Note: if you get an `import error` when you run the next cell, try changing your kernel (select the Kernel menu above --> Change Kernel).  Still have problems?  Try relaunching Jupyter Notebook from the terminal prompt. Also, check out [this forum post](https://carnd-forums.udacity.com/questions/22677062/answers/22677109) for more troubleshooting tips.**

**If you get an error that looks like this:**
```
NeedDownloadError: Need ffmpeg exe. 
You can download it by calling: 
imageio.plugins.ffmpeg.download()
```
**Follow the instructions in the error message and check out [this forum post](https://carnd-forums.udacity.com/display/CAR/questions/26218840/import-videofileclip-error) for more troubleshooting tips across operating systems.**


```python
# Import everything needed to edit/save/watch video clips
from moviepy.editor import VideoFileClip
from IPython.display import HTML
```


```python
def process_image(image):
    # NOTE: The output you return should be a color image (3 channel) for processing video below
    # TODO: put your pipeline here,
    # you should return the final output (image where lines are drawn on lanes)
    result = draw_lane_lines(image)
    
    return result
```

Let's try the one with the solid white lane on the right first ...


```python
white_output = 'test_videos_output/solidWhiteRight.mp4'
## To speed up the testing process you may want to try your pipeline on a shorter subclip of the video
## To do so add .subclip(start_second,end_second) to the end of the line below
## Where start_second and end_second are integer values representing the start and end of the subclip
## You may also uncomment the following line for a subclip of the first 5 seconds
# clip1 = VideoFileClip("test_videos/solidWhiteRight.mp4").subclip(0,5)
clip1 = VideoFileClip("test_videos/solidWhiteRight.mp4")
white_clip = clip1.fl_image(process_image) #NOTE: this function expects color images!!
%time white_clip.write_videofile(white_output, audio=False)
```

Play the video inline, or if you prefer find the video in your filesystem (should be in the same directory) and play it in your video player of choice.

# //fasely recongize white car as lane line
```





<video width="960" height="540" controls>
  <source src="test_videos_output/solidWhiteRight.mp4">
</video>




## Improve the draw_lines() function

**At this point, if you were successful with making the pipeline and tuning parameters, you probably have the Hough line segments drawn onto the road, but what about identifying the full extent of the lane and marking it clearly as in the example video (P1_example.mp4)?  Think about defining a line to run the full length of the visible lane based on the line segments you identified with the Hough Transform. As mentioned previously, try to average and/or extrapolate the line segments you've detected to map out the full extent of the lane lines. You can see an example of the result you're going for in the video "P1_example.mp4".**

**Go back and modify your draw_lines function accordingly and try re-running your pipeline. The new output should draw a single, solid line over the left lane line and a single, solid line over the right lane line. The lines should start from the bottom of the image and extend out to the top of the region of interest.**

Now for the one with the solid yellow lane on the left. This one's more tricky!


```python
yellow_output = 'test_videos_output/solidYellowLeft.mp4'
## To speed up the testing process you may want to try your pipeline on a shorter subclip of the video
## To do so add .subclip(start_second,end_second) to the end of the line below

## You may also uncomment the following line for a subclip of the first 5 seconds
##clip2 = VideoFileClip('test_videos/solidYellowLeft.mp4').subclip(0,5)
clip2 = VideoFileClip('test_videos/solidYellowLeft.mp4')
yellow_clip = clip2.fl_image(process_image)
%time yellow_clip.write_videofile(yellow_output, audio=False)

## Writeup and Submission

If you're satisfied with your video outputs, it's time to make the report writeup in a pdf or markdown file. Once you have this Ipython notebook ready along with the writeup, it's time to submit for review! Here is a [link](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-LaneLines-P1/blob/master/writeup_template.md) to the writeup template file.


## Optional Challenge

Try your lane finding pipeline on the video below.  Does it still work?  Can you figure out a way to make it more robust?  If you're up for the challenge, modify your pipeline so it works with this video and submit it along with the rest of your project!
